                One day, a colleague asked, “Marissa, do you have Professor
                Charles Twist’s phone number?”<br />

                I said, “No, but you can call his brother.”<br />

                She blinked. “Who’s his brother?”<br />

                I grinned. “Oliver Twist, of course.”<br />

                She frowned. “But I don’t have Oliver Twist’s phone number
                either.”<br />

                At that point, I sighed. The joke was lost on her.<br />

                I'd been watching this little bluebird dad in my backyard, and
                my heart went out to him. He was working so hard, flying back
                and forth all day to feed his family. So when I found a big,
                juicy grub while gardening, I thought I’d help the guy out. I
                popped it right into the birdhouse.<br /><br />
                Big mistake. HUGE.<br /><br />
                Apparently, in the bluebird world, leaving a fat grub in another
                man’s house while he's out is the ultimate sign of disrespect.
                He didn't see a free meal; he saw a home-wrecker hitting on his
                wife.<br /><br />The next day, that bird went full-on Rambo. He
                sat on top of that birdhouse like a tiny, furious king,
                launching kamikaze attacks on anything with feathers. My
                peaceful backyard turned into an avian war zone, all because I
                tried to be a good neighbor. Lesson learned: Don't leave
                unsolicited grubs on someone's doorstep. You might just start a
                gang war.

                The first time and last time I ever got drunk, I was so
                convinced I was sober that I was ready to take my car to a
                mechanic.<br /><br />
                After a German Embassy reception, I was driving friends home.
                Now, I’d never been drunk before, so I honestly felt fine. The
                car, however, did not. It kept veering wildly onto the
                sidewalks.<br /><br />My friends, white-knuckled in their seats,
                yelled, "Marissa!"<br /><br />Annoyed at my car's betrayal, I
                told them, "I know, I know! It's acting crazy! I have to take it
                in to get fixed first thing tomorrow."<br /><br />My friends
                went dead silent for the rest of the ride.<br /><br /><i

                After a late-night session of watching the Columbo detective
                show with my dad, I announced to my sister the next morning that
                my meditation had paid off - I could read minds.<br /><br />"I'll
                prove it," I said. "Pick a number between one and five."
                "Three," she said, rolling her eyes. "Okay," I replied calmly.
                "Now open the dictionary that's been on the couch next to you
                the whole time. Turn to page 300." Tucked inside was a slip of
                paper that read: "I know you would choose three."<br /><br />The
                look on her face was priceless. My brothers ran in to see what
                the pandemonium was about, and they were all stumped. There were
                no other strips of paper in the dictionary. They begged me to do
                it again. "Okay," my sister said, "Two!" I told her to look
                under the desk calendar on the TV. Sure enough, another note: "I
                know you would choose two." They were losing their minds.<br /><br />My
                secret? I had notes for one, two, three, four, and five hidden
                all over the room. That's what they get for not watching Columbo
                with us.

                I was with my team from Glaxo - medical doctors, waiting right
                outside - and I popped into the bathroom. I saw a woman using a
                hand dryer and I was like, "Cool!"<br /><br />I finished up,
                went over to the dryer... and I couldn't find the switch! I
                looked from above, below, at the sides, everywhere! The darn
                switch was nowhere to be seen. Then, someone else walked in.
                Total panic! I pretended like I was just admiring the wall,
                trying to look casual. I didn't want to look like an ignorant
                idiot!<br /><br />As soon as she went into a stall, I was back
                at it, frantically searching. I finally admitted defeat, wiped
                my wet hands on my jeans, and walked out. My team asked what
                took so long. My brilliant reply after my epic battle with
                technology? "Oh, nothing."

                A nurse told my husband he had to wait in the car because of
                COVID restrictions. I looked at her with wide, innocent eyes and
                asked, "But who is going to translate for me?"<br />Her: "You...
                you don't speak English?"<br />Me: "Not a word."<br />Her: "So
                you can't understand anything I'm saying right now?"<br />Me:
                "Precisely."<br />
                The genuine distress that washed over her face was a sight to

                English.

                I learned a valuable lesson at Monet's garden in Giverny: if
                you're going to play dumb, you have to fully commit.<br /><br />After
                getting bumped one too many times while trying to take a video
                in a dense crowd, I hopped a "Do Not Cross" rope onto a
                pristine, empty patch of lawn. It was perfect... for about 30
                seconds, until a staff member marched over.<br /><br />Her:
                "Hey, you can't be on the lawn. Didn't you see the sign?"<br /><br />Me
                (thinking I'm a genius): "Me no speak English."<br /><br />
                Her (not impressed): "Bullshit. You just understood my
                English."<br /><br />
                Without even thinking, my mouth blurted out, "I did?"<br /><br />Yeah.
                My brilliant plan lasted all of five seconds.

                Apparently, "having a cow" does not involve any actual
                livestock. I learned this the hard way.<br /><br />One day, my
                step-daughter announced, "My mom is having a cow." My brain
                immediately conjured up this horrifying image of her mom
                literally... biting a live cow. I suggested, "That's a horrible
                image. Can't you just say she's 'eating beef'?" After a
                world-class eye-roll, she just sighed, "Forget it," and walked
                out of the room.<br /><br />Learning American slang is a
                minefield. Imagine someone says, “Break a leg” and you literally
                act on it.

                An immigration officer in Brussels nearly got a heart attack. He
                was going through the standard questions, looking at my
                passport.<br />Officer: "How many countries are you visiting on
                this trip?"<br />Me: "Six countries."<br />He nodded, getting
                his stamp ready.<br />
                Officer: "And how many days will you be staying?"<br />Me:
                "Three days."<br />He froze. The stamp hovered mid-air. He
                looked up at me, his eyes wide with a mix of awe and deep
                suspicion.<br />Officer: "Six... countries? In three days?"<br />It
                took a second to realize he meant the entire trip, while I was
                only answering for our three-day stop in Belgium. Whoops. For a
                moment there, I'm pretty sure he thought he'd caught the world's
                most overly ambitious, and possibly insane, tourist.

                The cheapest mistake in Annecy

                We were in a foul mood after being stung with a €25 toll on the
                way to Annecy, France. So when we immediately found ourselves on
                another toll road by mistake on our way to dinner, we made a
                cranky-tourist decision: we saw the open gate and drove straight
                through without a ticket.<br /><br />
                <b>Spoiler alert: you can't get off without a ticket.</b
                ><br /><br />Stuck at the next gate, my husband launched into a
                rapid-fire English explanation that basically spun the poor
                guard's head. He just held up a hand and said, "Attendez, je
                vais appeler le responsable." (Wait, I'm going to call the
                supervisor.)<br /><br />Oh, great. We pictured it all: a
                one-hour wait, a lecture in French, and a fine big enough to
                ruin our appetite. After a long call - likely describing the
                crazy Americans he'd trapped - the guard turned to us with a
                deadpan look and held out his hand. "Fifty cents." The relief
                was incredible. We paid the man and got out of there like we'd
                just pulled off the world's cheapest, dumbest heist.

                My cooking skills once received the most brutally honest
                two-part review in history.<br /><br />Part One: After I spent
                three hours making rice soup for the sick Mother Superior, she
                took a single sip and declared, "This is terrible. I won't eat
                it." Ouch. I was convinced she was wrong.<br /><br />Part Two
                (The Tie-Breaker): I summoned a stray dog as the ultimate
                impartial judge. I poured the soup into a bowl. He sniffed it,
                looked up at me with what I can only describe as great pity, and
                trotted off.<br /><br />That’s when it hit me. "Oh," I thought
                to myself. "It's that bad. Huh."
