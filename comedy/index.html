              When our 8-year-old, Ashley, offered to help with the dishes, we
              thought, “How sweet!”<br /><br />Five minutes later, half a bottle
              of soap was gone—and only three plates were clean.<br /><br />Her
              dad gently said, “Sweetheart, you don’t need that much soap.”<br /><br />Ashley
              climbed off her stool, crossed her arms, and delivered the line of
              a lifetime:<br /><br />“If you don’t like the way I do things, get
              yourself another woman.”<br /><br />Geez! We still don’t know
              which TV show she got that from, but her dishwashing privileges
              remain… unquestioned.

              My husband, Robert, once discovered a whole new family of African
              wildlife, all with the same name: the Sijui.<br /><br />
              He was on a trip with a Swahili guide when he spotted a strange
              monkey."What kind of monkey is that?" he asked. The guide
              replied,"Sijui." Robert, thrilled, snapped a photo and dutifully
              jotted down the name.<br /><br />
              A little later, a colorful bird flew by."And that one?" The guide
              looked up."Sijui." Robert was a bit puzzled but wrote it down
              again: The Sijui Bird.<br /><br />
              When they saw a third unfamiliar animal and the guide again
              identified it as a"Sijui," Robert couldn't take it anymore. "Oh,
              come on!" he said."You can't name everything Sijui!"<br /><br />
              The guide just smiled."No, sir," he said gently."Sijui means 'I
              don't know.'"

              My husband, Robert, once watched a man go from cheerful tourist to
              full believer in Hawaiian curses in just three days.<br /><br />
              Robert and his friend were hiking a petroglyph trail on the Big
              Island of Hawaii when his buddy picked up a lava rock.<br /><br />
              Robert, ever the joker, warned him: “You don’t take rocks from
              Pele, the volcano goddess. That’s how you get cursed.”🔥<br /><br />
              Spooked, the friend threw it back — and the rock split in half.
              Robert said, “Well… now you’ve <i>really</i> done it.”
              <br /><br />
              <b>Five minutes later</b>, his friend tripped and broke his
              camera. <br />
              <b>That night</b>, a jellyfish stung only him while scuba diving.
              <br />
              <b>Two days later</b>, back home, his girlfriend dumped him.
              <br />
              <br /><br />
              By the end, his friend became a firm believer in Hawaiian
              curses.🌋

              Twice Out of Place at the Waldorf Astoria Versailles

            <hr />

            <p class="ep-text" data-translation-key="november-waldorf">
              We checked in to the Waldorf Astoria Versailles after a long day
              of travel, looking exactly how you'd expect: tired, hungry, and in
              jeans. We hit the bar, just as the dinner crowd began to
              <i>arrive</i>. And I mean <i>arrive</i>. These people were in
              gowns, dripping with jewelry, and walking in a cloud of expensive
              perfume. We felt so out of place.<br /><br />Determined to fit in,
              I wore the only modest dress I packed for the trip to breakfast
              the next morning. I walked into that buffet ... and was met by a
              sea of people in sweatpants, hoodies, and complimentary hotel
              slippers.<br /><br />Apparently, "dressed to the nines" is for
              dinner, but the over-priced breakfast buffet is strictly for those
              who have given up all pretensions. I've never felt so out of
              place, twice.

            <p class="ep-text" data-translation-key="november-lonely">
              Being the only child of divorced parents, my teenage cousin once
              tried to lay a guilt trip on her doctor mom, and it backfired
              spectacularly.<br /><br />She was laying it on thick: "Mom, I wish
              we could spend more time together. You come back from the
              hospital, have a quick dinner, and go right to your clinic. I
              don’t get to see you until after nine. I’m so lonely!"<br /><br />Her
              mom, a strategic genius, replied, "Well, honey, the hospital
              salary doesn't pay for all those fancy clothes and jewelry you
              love so much. The clinic does. But if you want, I can absolutely
              quit the clinic."<br /><br />My cousin's "sad" face immediately
              turned into a "wait, let's not be hasty" face.<br /><br />"Oh,"
              she stammered. "Well... if you put it that way..." She walked away
              and, magically, the complaint was never heard again.

              Shopping Strategy
            </h2>

            <hr />

            <p class="ep-text" data-translation-key="november-furniture">
              I've stumbled upon the single greatest shopping strategy for a
              happy marriage: I call it "Strategic Sticker Shock."<br /><br />We
              were furnishing our new home, so I took Robert to the Pacific
              Design Center in LA, a place so fancy that the price tags are
              considered offensive. You know the rule: if you have to ask, you
              can't afford it. I, of course, immediately started asking for
              prices.<br /><br />A headboard? $5,000. (the bed not included). An
              exquisite dining table? $20,000. "Are the chairs included?" I
              asked. The saleswoman responded, "No, ma'am. The chairs are
              $1,500... apiece."<br /><br />By this point, all the blood had
              drained from Robert's face. "Let’s go, Marissa," he whispered. "We
              don’t belong here." But I was fascinated! "No way," I said. "This
              is another universe. I'm going to look at everything." Even a vase
              I liked was $3,000.<br /><br />Defeated, we left, and I grabbed a
              catalog near the entrance. At lunch, I discovered the catalog cost
              $25, not free. I had to do the walk of shame to sneak it back.<br /><br />The
              next day, it was so much fun.<br /><br />I took Robert, still
              dazed, to a normal furniture store. I found a couch I loved. "How
              much is this?" I asked. "$3,000," said the saleswoman. Robert,
              said, "Get it." to everything I wanted. He’s so relived that I had
              come back down to earth.<br /><br />And that, my friends, is how
              you shop. You don't show men the price; you present them the
              worst-case scenario first. Afterwards, they'll be in their most
              pliable mood.

              One day, the young Barnaby went on an “expedition” to explore a
              nearby cornfield - a venture as ambitious as Columbus setting sail
              without a compass.<br /><br />
              His sole companion was his pet pig – a rotund philosopher,
              possessing the rare gift of both common sense and a punctual
              appetite. The pig, apparently, was the brains of the partnership -
              though Barnaby, poor lad, remained blissfully unaware of the pig’s
              superior intelligence.<br /><br />For a while, the pair meandered
              amid the rustling stalks, but as the clock struck four – the pig’s
              sacred hour of supper - it promptly abandoned its master to his
              fate and trotted home.<br /><br />Dusk arrived, the field grew
              sinister, and Barnaby—abandoned, bewildered, and tragically
              snackless—dissolved into tears and stumbled upon a nearby
              cottage.<br /><br />
              When his mother arrived to pick him up, she looked at her
              disheveled son, and remarked, “"Well, it appears the pig, at
              least, possesses sufficient intelligence to return for his supper.
              One cannot, it seems, say the same for my son."

              Low-Maintenance, My Foot
            </h2>

            <hr />

            <p class="ep-text" data-translation-key="november-low">
              My husband used to brag about me. “She’s so low-maintenance!” he’d
              tell our friends, just because I’m not into jewelry. Poor, sweet,
              naive man. He confused <i>low-maintenance</i> with
              <i>different priorities</i>.<br /><br />
              His first clue should’ve been before the wedding. I told him,
              “Instead of a ring, I want a new laptop.” He was baffled. “What’s
              wrong with your current laptop?” I sighed. “It’s two years old.
              That is what’s wrong with it.” I had to explain in layman’s terms
              that in computer years, my two-year-old machine was basically 80.
              I even suggested that instead of a ring-bearer, we have a
              laptop-bear. He could say, “With this laptop, I thee wed!”<br /><br />The
              fantasy of his practical wife died completely once I took over the
              grocery shopping. He’d look at the bags and ask what things cost.
              My response? “I don’t know. I wanted them, so I bought them.”
              Simple logic.<br /><br />At this point, he may well regret his
              assumptions. Alas, he missed the fine print:
              <i
                >With Asian wives, all sales are final. No returns. No
                refunds</i
              >.
