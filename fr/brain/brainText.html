        <h5>Neurocognitive Foundations</h5>
        <p>
          Neural plasticity and synaptic pruning are fundamental, intertwined
          biological processes that allow the brain to adapt, learn, and
          maintain efficiency throughout a lifespan. While plasticity refers to
          the brain's ability to reorganize and modify its connections, pruning
          is the specific mechanism of eliminating unnecessary connections to
          refine neural circuitry.
        </p>
        <p>
          <b>1. Neural Plasticity</b><br />
          Neural plasticity (or brain plasticity) is the brain's capacity to
          alter its structure, function, and connections in response to
          environmental stimuli, learning, experience, injury, or disease. It is
          the biological foundation of all learning, transforming passive
          information recording into a physical process of reorganization.
          Plasticity generally manifests in two forms:
        </p>
        <ul>
          <li>
            <b>Structural Plasticity</b>: This involves physical changes to
            neural networks, such as the generation of new neurons
            (neurogenesis), the formation of new synapses (synaptogenesis), and
            the remodeling of dendritic spines. For example, the hippocampus—a
            region critical for memory—continues to generate new neurons into
            adulthood, a process enhanced by factors like physical exercise and
            environmental enrichment.
          </li>
          <li>
            <b>Functional Plasticity</b>: This refers to changes in the
            efficiency, strength, and synchrony of existing synaptic
            connections. This is often driven by Long-Term Potentiation (LTP),
            where repeated stimulation strengthens the connection between
            neurons ("neurons that fire together, wire together"), and Long-Term
            Depression (LTD), where connections are weakened.
          </li>
        </ul>
        <p>
          <b>Developmental Trajectory</b>: Plasticity is most robust during
          perinatal and early childhood periods, characterized by a "critical
          period" of heightened sensitivity to environmental input. However, the
          adult brain retains considerable adaptive capacity. Unlike the rapid,
          bottom-up plasticity seen in childhood, adult plasticity is often more
          regulated, context-dependent, and driven by top-down processes like
          attention or specific training.
        </p>
        <p>
          <b>2. Synaptic Pruning</b><br />Synaptic Pruning Synaptic pruning is a
          crucial refinement process within neural plasticity. During early
          development, the brain produces an overabundance of synaptic
          connections. Pruning is the systematic elimination of these excess,
          weak, or seldom-used synapses to increase the efficiency of neuronal
          signaling.
        </p>
        <p>
          <b>Mechanisms of Pruning</b>: Pruning operates on an
          "activity-dependent" basis: active synapses are stabilized, while
          inactive ones are marked for removal. This process is largely mediated
          by microglia, the brain's resident immune cells, which engulf and
          digest weak synapses. This interaction is governed by specific
          molecular signaling pathways:
        </p>
        <ul>
          <li>
            <b>"Eat Me" Signals</b>: The classical complement cascade acts as a
            tagging system. Proteins such as C1q and C3 localize to weak or
            apoptotic synapses. Microglia express receptors (like CR3) that
            recognize these tags and trigger phagocytosis (engulfment).
            Phosphatidylserine (PS) is another "eat me" signal exposed on
            synapses targeted for elimination.
          </li>
          <li>
            <b>"Don't Eat Me" Signals</b>: To protect active and strong
            synapses, neurons express protective molecules like CD47, which
            binds to the SIRPα receptor on microglia to inhibit engulfment. The
            CD200/CD200R axis also functions as a checkpoint to prevent
            excessive pruning.
          </li>
          <li>
            <b>Timing</b>: While pruning is most intense during childhood and
            adolescence—particularly in the prefrontal cortex which governs
            decision-making—it continues at a reduced pace into adulthood. This
            refinement is essential for cognitive skills, ensuring the brain
            does not expend metabolic energy maintaining unnecessary pathways.
          </li>
        </ul>
        <p>
          <b>Metaphorical Summary</b><br />You can view neural plasticity as the
          growth of a dense garden, where plants (neurons) sprout branches and
          vines (synapses) to connect with one another. Synaptic pruning is the
          gardener who trims back the overgrowth, removing weak or tangling
          vines to ensure the strongest plants get enough sunlight and resources
          to thrive. Without the gardener, the garden becomes a tangled,
          inefficient mess; with an over-aggressive gardener, the garden becomes
          sparse and barren.

        <h5>Declarative/Procedural Model</h5>
        <p>
          According to the Declarative/Procedural (DP) model, the distinction
          between the mental lexicon and mental grammar is supported by two
          separate brain memory systems that also underlie non-linguistic
          functions. The model posits that the memory system used for facts and
          events (declarative) supports the lexicon, while the system used for
          motor and cognitive skills (procedural) supports grammar.
        </p>
        <p>
          <b>The Mental Lexicon and Declarative Memory</b><br />The declarative
          memory system is responsible for the mental lexicon, which acts as a
          repository for all idiosyncratic and arbitrary linguistic information.
        </p>
        <ul>
          <li>
            <b>Function</b>: This system stores word-specific knowledge where
            the relationship between sound and meaning is arbitrary (e.g., the
            word "cat") or unpredictable (e.g., irregular past tenses like
            "teach/taught"). It functions as an associative memory that binds
            disparate pieces of information together,.
          </li>
          <li>
            <b>Characteristics</b>: Knowledge in this system is typically
            explicit (available to conscious recollection) and is not
            "informationally encapsulated," meaning it is accessible to other
            mental systems.
          </li>
          <li>
            <b>Neural Substrate</b>: This system is rooted in the temporal lobe.
            Learning new words relies on medial temporal lobe structures (such
            as the hippocampus), while the long-term storage of word meanings
            and sounds depends on neocortical areas in the temporal and
            temporoparietal regions,.
          </li>
        </ul>
        <p>
          <b>The Mental Grammar and Procedural Memory</b><br />The procedural
          memory system supports the mental grammar, which governs the
          rule-based combination of lexical forms.
        </p>
        <ul>
          <li>
            <b>Function</b>: This system subserves the implicit learning and use
            of a symbol-manipulating grammar, covering subdomains like syntax,
            morphology, and phonology. It is responsible for
            "grammatical-structure building," allowing for the sequential and
            hierarchical combination of stored forms into complex structures
            (e.g., combining "walk" + "-ed").
          </li>
          <li>
            <b>Characteristics</b>: The operation of this system is largely
            implicit (subconscious) and is informationally encapsulated, meaning
            it has relatively little access to other cognitive systems.
          </li>
          <li>
            <b>Neural Substrate</b>: This system is rooted in the frontal cortex
            (specifically Broca’s area and the supplementary motor area) and the
            basal ganglia,. These structures are traditionally associated with
            learning and controlling motor sequences, suggesting that
            grammatical rules are processed similarly to other cognitive and
            motor skills.
          </li>
        </ul>
        <p>
          <b>Evidence from Morphology and Neurological Disorders</b><br />The
          distinction between these systems is empirically supported by how the
          brain processes regular versus irregular morphology:
        </p>
        <ul>
          <li>
            <b>Irregular forms</b> (e.g., dig-dug) are arbitrary and must be
            memorized; therefore, they depend on the lexicon/declarative memory
          </li>
          <li>
            <b>Regular forms</b> (e.g., walk-walked) follow a default rule and
            are computed in real-time by the grammar/procedural system
          </li>
        </ul>
        <p>
          This separation is evidenced by a double dissociation seen in various
          neurological conditions:
        </p>
        <ul>
          <li>
            <b>Temporal Lobe Damage (Declarative Deficits)</b>: Patients with
            Alzheimer’s disease or posterior aphasia (damage to the
            temporal/temporoparietal regions) have difficulty processing
            irregular forms (lexical items) but retain the ability to process
            regular forms (rule-based).
          </li>
          <li>
            <b>Frontal/Basal Ganglia Damage (Procedural Deficits)</b>: Patients
            with Parkinson’s disease, Huntington’s disease, or anterior aphasia
            (damage to the frontal cortex or basal ganglia) show the opposite
            pattern: they struggle with regular, rule-governed forms but exhibit
            relatively intact processing of irregular, memorized forms.
          </li>
        </ul>
      </div>
      <div class="english-text" data-aos="fade-up" id="plasticity">
        <h5>Neuroplasticity</h5>
        <p>
          Neuroplasticity allows the brain to adapt during language acquisition
          through a variety of structural, functional, and molecular mechanisms.
          These processes differ depending on the age of the learner (infant vs.
          adult), the type of language learning (first vs. second language), and
          the presence of neurological injury.
        </p>
        <p>
          <b>1. Structural Remodeling: Synaptic Pruning and Genesis</b><br />
          Neuroplasticity physically reshapes the brain to optimize language
          processing through the creation and elimination of neural connections.
        </p>
        <ul>
          <li>
            <b>Synaptic Pruning</b>: During early development, the brain
            produces an overabundance of synapses. Through a process called
            synaptic pruning, weak or unused connections are eliminated while
            active connections are strengthened. This refinement is essential
            for forming precise neural circuits for language. Microglia (the
            brain's immune cells) play a central role in this process by
            engulfing synapses tagged with "eat me" signals (such as complement
            proteins C1q and C3) while sparing those with "don't eat me" signals
            (such as CD47). This process is activity-dependent, meaning the
            brain retains the connections stimulated by the specific language
            environment.
          </li>
          <li>
            <b>Synaptogenesis and Cortical Thickness</b>: Learning a language
            induces the formation of new synapses (synaptogenesis) and increases
            cortical thickness in key language areas. For example, adult
            language learners exhibit increased cortical thickness in the left
            inferior frontal gyrus and superior temporal gyrus, providing
            greater neural resources for processing.
          </li>
          <li>
            <b>White Matter Integrity</b>: Plasticity also involves the
            modification of white matter tracts (the brain's cabling). Language
            learning enhances the integrity and myelination of tracts like the
            arcuate fasciculus and superior longitudinal fasciculus,
            facilitating faster signal transmission between language regions.
          </li>
        </ul>
        <p>
          <b>2. Functional Reorganization and Efficiency</b><br />
          As language is acquired, the brain shifts how it processes information
          to become more efficient.
        </p>
        <ul>
          <li>
            <b>Perceptual Narrowing</b>: In infancy, the brain is initially open
            to all phonetic sounds. During a critical period (roughly 6–12
            months), neuroplasticity allows the brain to specialize in the
            phonemes of the native language while losing sensitivity to
            non-native contrasts. This "tuning" allows for optimal processing of
            the native tongue.
          </li>
          <li>
            <b>Shift from Explicit to Implicit Processing</b>: In adult
            second-language (L2) acquisition, the brain initially recruits
            prefrontal executive control regions to manage the new language
            explicitly. As proficiency increases, plasticity allows for a shift
            toward implicit, automatic processing, engaging subcortical
            structures like the basal ganglia.
          </li>
          <li>
            <b>Native-like Neural Signatures</b>: With specific types of
            training (particularly implicit or immersion-like training), adult
            brains can adapt to show "native-like" electrical patterns (such as
            the AN+P600 Event-Related Potential signature) in response to
            grammatical violations. This indicates a shift from relying on
            lexical/semantic mechanisms (typical of novices) to automatic
            rule-based processing.
          </li>
        </ul>
        <p>
          <b>3. Memory System Co-optation and Compensation</b><br />The brain
          adapts to language acquisition constraints by recruiting different
          memory systems depending on the learner's developmental stage.
        </p>
        <ul>
          <li>
            <b>Declarative vs. Procedural Systems</b>: The
            Declarative/Procedural (DP) model suggests that while children
            acquire grammar implicitly via the procedural system, adults often
            compensate for reduced procedural plasticity by co-opting the
            declarative memory system (normally used for facts) to learn
            grammatical rules explicitly.
          </li>
          <li>
            <b>Competitive and Cooperative Interactions</b>: These memory
            systems interact dynamically. For example, learning in the
            declarative system can initially block the proceduralization of
            grammar, but over time, procedural memory can override declarative
            knowledge as skills become automatized.
          </li>
        </ul>
        <p>
          <b>4. Adaptation to Injury (Hemispheric Plasticity)</b><br />The
          plasticity of the language network is most evident in how the brain
          adapts to injury early in life.
        </p>
        <ul>
          <li>
            <b>Inter-hemispheric Transfer</b>: If the left hemisphere (the
            dominant language side) is damaged perinatally, the developing brain
            can successfully reorganize language functions to the right
            hemisphere. Functional MRI studies show that language organizes in
            right-hemisphere regions that are mirror images of the typical
            left-hemisphere language network.
          </li>
          <li>
            <b>Limitations in Adulthood</b>: This extreme plasticity diminishes
            with age. In adults who suffer strokes, the brain attempts to
            compensate by recruiting perilesional areas (tissue surrounding the
            injury) or right-hemisphere homologs, but this reorganization is
            generally less effective than in children and often does not support
            full language recovery.
          </li>
        </ul>
        <p>
          <b>5. Modulation by Environment and Physiology</b
          ><br />Neuroplasticity during language acquisition is not automatic;
          it is modulated by environmental and biological factors.
        </p>
        <ul>
          <li>
            <b>Sensory and Social Gating</b>: Plasticity is driven by active
            engagement. "Multisensory learning" leverages crossmodal plasticity,
            where combining visual, auditory, and kinesthetic inputs strengthens
