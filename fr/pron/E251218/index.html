            <span class="chunk"> Such reforms - </span>

            <span class="chunk"> and ditching distorting subsidies - </span>

            <span class="chunk"> many previous reformers have failed. </span>
            <span class="chunk"> Yet Mr Milei stuck to his chainsaw </span>
            <span class="chunk"> in 2025, </span>

            <span class="chunk"> The results have been impressive. </span>
