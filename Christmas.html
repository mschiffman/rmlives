            <p>
              Our daughter Sarah and her husband welcomed a beautiful baby boy,
              Lucas, on June 2. We are overjoyed to celebrate the arrival of our
              first grandchild! Holding that tiny bundle of love for the first
              time was pure magic — our hearts are fuller than ever. 💙

            <p>
              In July, we visited the breathtaking Butchart Gardens in Canada —
              what an absolute delight! It’s inspiring to see how an old quarry
              was transformed into a lush paradise, now enjoyed by millions each
              year. Surrounded by blossoms, fountains, and laughter, we were
              reminded how beauty can bloom even in the most unexpected places.

            <h3>🏰 A Touch of Elegance in Victoria</h3>
            <p>
              We stayed at the Fairmont Empress Hotel in Victoria, a magnificent
              landmark designed by architect Francis Rattenbury. The building
              itself is truly impressive, full of charm and history. Each
              evening, we loved strolling along the waterfront — breathing in
              the crisp sea air, watching street performers, and soaking in the
              lively atmosphere. It was pure joy from start to finish.

            <p>
              Our beloved Teddy turned three this year! Despite his picky eating
              habits (which still test our patience now and then), his gentle
              heart and playful spirit bring sunshine to our lives every single
              day. Since he’s so hairy — and has a tendency to pout when he
              decides we haven’t played with him enough — we affectionately call
              him our “Hairy Pouter.” It fits him perfectly!

            <p>
              In early August, we moved to sunny Florida to be closer to our
              precious grandson. The warmer weather is already doing wonders for
              John’s achy joints, and Marie — ever the garden enthusiast — is
              thrilled to have half an acre of land to turn into her own little
              paradise. It feels like the start of a beautiful new chapter!

              flowers have become quite the talk of the neighborhood. Neighbors

              John captured this stunning photo of an Eastern Tiger Swallowtail

              honing his photography skills on the flowers and wildlife in
              Marie’s garden. Enjoying breakfast in the sunroom, surrounded by
              blooms and the cheerful songs of birds, has been an absolute
              delight — a perfect way to start the day!

              We can hardly believe how vibrant the flowers still look in
              November! The zinnias, one of Marie’s favorite cut flowers, have
              been especially lovely — cheerful, long-lasting, and so easy to
              care for. They’ve filled the garden (and a few vases indoors) with
              color and joy well into the season.

            <p>
              Thanksgiving dinner was especially memorable this year thanks to
              one tiny bundle of joy — little Lucas. He may be too young to
              enjoy the delicious feast, but his sweet smiles and cheerful
              giggles filled our hearts in a way no dish ever could.
